                        The home buying experience can be exciting.  You’re ready to settle down or upgrade to more space for your family.  But
                        with all the action surrounding getting pre-approved, finding a reputable Real Estate Agent and vising open houses, there’s
                        one thing that can’t be forgotten during the excitement – your closing costs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What Exactly Are Closing Costs?</h3>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A buyer can expect to pay between 2% - 5% of their loan in closing costs.  The exact amount a home buyer has to pay in
                        closing costs can vary a lot depending on the home price, location and a variety of other factors.
                    </p>



                    <h3>Breakdown of Typical Closing Costs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Origination fee — This is the lender’s charge for its services, including the cost to verify your documents, process your
                        application, and get the loan set up. The origination fee is often around 1% of the loan amount
                    </p>

            WriteLiteral(@"ee — A home appraisal typically costs around $500, but could be as much as $1,000. The home appraisal usually

                    <p>
                        Title search and title insurance — A title search makes sure your new home’s title is clear, meaning no one else can
                        claim rights to the home or property. Title insurance provides protection against undiscovered claims
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upfront mortgage insurance or funding fee — Some types of home loans require an upfront fee to insure or ‘guarantee’ the
                        mortgage. Government-backed loans, including FHA, VA, and USDA mortgages, all have such a fee, though you can typically
                        roll this into your loan amount instead of paying at closing
                    </p>

                        assuming the buyer will buy points at closing
