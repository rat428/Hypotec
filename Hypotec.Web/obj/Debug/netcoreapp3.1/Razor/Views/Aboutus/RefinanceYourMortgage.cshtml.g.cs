                        Unless you’re living under a rock, we’re sure you’ve heard the news that interest rates are at ALL TIME LOWS.  But what does
                        this mean?  If you are finding it difficult to service your mortgage, or wish to benefit from lower interest rates, you can
                        opt for refinancing. Many private and government-controlled home refinancing programs are available to the general public.
                        As long as you meet their criteria, you can refinance your mortgage.

                        The guesswork is minimal on why this would be a goal you’re looking to achieve.  A top reason why people look into
                        refinancing their mortgage is they’re looking to shorten the period of their loan.  Many people find themselves in
                        a stable financial situation and are looking for ways to rid themselves of their pesky monthly mortgage payment sooner.
                        Refinancing offers the opportunity to shorten the term of your loan, very possibly at a significantly lower rate, thus
                        SAVING you 1000’s of dollars off the life of your loan.

                        replaced for a new one with a larger amount than owed on the previously existing loan.  This helps borrowers use their home

                        One of the most common reasons one may look to refinance their loan is to lessen their monthly payment.  If you successfully
                        refinance your loan at a lower interest rate, you would be able to save hefty amounts on interest.  The extra cash that you
                        save monthly due to lower interest rates could be then be invested elsewhere.

                        simply refinancing. Even better, you could get lower interest rates for a shorter loan period which would make it a true
