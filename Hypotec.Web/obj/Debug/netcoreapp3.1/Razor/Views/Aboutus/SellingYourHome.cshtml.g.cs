                        It’s time consuming, it can be emotional, it’s overwhelming – let’s face it, it’s A LOT when you’re looking to put your
                        home on the market.  First time home sellers may find the process frustrating and it’s very common for mistakes to be made
                        during the process.  Check out the biggest mistakes to avoid when looking to sell your home.

                        Yes.  Will it cost you a significant amount more to work through an agent?  Probably not.  When working with a trusted,
                        reputable Real Estate Agent, a lot of the guesswork is taken out of the selling process.  Rest assured, a Real Estate Agent
                        will have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to all aspects of your selling your home – especially the legalities that you
                        likely aren’t aware of.  They are quite literally working on behalf of you, their client, and will be able to guide and
                        negotiate what truly is best for your individual circumstance.  A 5-6% commission is typically paid off the sale price of a
                        home to a seller’s agent but keep in mind, houses managed under a Real Estate Agent typically sell in upwards of 10% or more

                        to represent you in the selling process?  Their fee is split with the buyer’s agent thus negating your need to pay the
                        buyer’s agent commission yourself.

                    <h3>Setting An Outrageous Price</h3>
                    <p>
                        When surveyed, 70% of Real Estate Agents stated the biggest mistake a seller can make is to overprice the home.  A
                        comparative market analysis is typically done and it will be easy to see, and sway away from, those that overprice their
                        home.  We all want to get the most we can out of the sale, but doing the opposite of hiking up the price could yield you
                        even better results.  Setting a fair or under priced listing will typically generate multiple offers and often ignite a
                        bidding war.  This is a better tactic to reach your desired sale price.  And remember – you don’t have to accept offers
                        that you feel come in too low.

                        selling process up for failure.  Any major issues WILL be discovered during the home inspection.  There are three options
                        you should choose from instead:  fix the problems ahead of time, price the property below market value to help accommodate
                        the issues or offer the buyer a credit to fix the issue.  One thing to keep in mind – if you choose not to fix the problem
                        ahead of time, you will lose out on all the potential buyers who are looking for a turnkey home.

                        transaction.  It can be hard to separate emotions from the equation, but to achieve the best success out of your home sale,
                        it’s always best to approach the sale with a clear mind focused on the action of selling.
