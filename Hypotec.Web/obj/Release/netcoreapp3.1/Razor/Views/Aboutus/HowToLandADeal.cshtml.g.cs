                    <p>
                        When looking for a new home in today’s market, the most important step you need to take is to get pre-approved for a loan.
                        A mortgage pre-approval will give you a sense of the amount you are qualified to borrow, what your interest rate will likely
                        be and the amount of your monthly mortgage payment.  Getting pre-approved helps you shop for homes within your means and
                        shows you're a serious buyer. If you start home shopping before you finish the pre-approval process, you may be in for a
                        not so nice surprise when you apply for a mortgage and discover you qualify for much less.  If you’re in the market to buy
                        a home, <a href=""#"">start your pre-approval process here today</a>.

                        integral to work with an agent who has a strong knowledge of the local community you’re looking to purchase in.  It will
                        be advantageous for them to also have solid relationships with other realtors in the area.  Your Real Estate Agent will
                        be your right hand man (or woman) throughout this entire process.  Check out our recommended agents for your local market
