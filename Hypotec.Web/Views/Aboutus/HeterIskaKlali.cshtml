                            All parties who receive funds from the aforementioned company (herein the “Managing Partner(s)”) shall accept said funds 
                            as would a Managing Partner. Any profits, capital gains, or losses arising from this investment shall be borne by the

                            regarding the amount of profits generated by the joint venture must be verified with a solemn oath, administered by 
                            an Orthodox Jewish court of law, by a representative of the Company deemed acceptable to said court of law. This iska 
                            shall be structured as palga pikadon i.e. in a manner that is half investment and half loan.
